# ReadMe Generator

## Description
To help developers quickly create a read me I created a command line program that generates a README.md file which is saved in the Output folder.

## Table of Contents
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [License](#license)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [Tests](#tests)
- [Questions](#questions)

## Installation
 1 - git clone the repo \n 2 - use npm i in the repo to download the relevant libraries \n 3 - run index.js from the command line and enter in the relevant data

## Usage
After running index.js in node from the command line You'll be prompted with several questions about your project. Your answers will then be saved into the README as the content under each heading
